# Vbtiver

Vbtizer is a tiny css framework. You can use it as a basis for your own projects.

## Getting Started

**Vbtizer** is on development state but you you can [download](https://github.com/Rincorpes/vbtizer/archive/master.zip) it and start using it just by adding the files ``vbtizer.min.css`` and ``vbtizer.min.js`` located on ``dist/css`` and ``dist/js`` respectively.

You need **jQuery** to make vbtizer jQuery plugins work.

Otherwise you can clone the whole code from its [repository](https://github.com/Rincorpes/vbtizer) and build using it as a basis.

### About contributing
